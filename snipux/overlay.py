"""Frozen-frame selection windows, one per monitor.

Per CLAUDE.md's one architectural rule, the compositor is only ever asked
for pixels once (in `capture.py`). Everything here is ordinary painting and
mouse/key handling on the `Frame` that grab already produced — no code path
in this module asks for a fresh screen read while the user is dragging.

`Overlay` never re-zeroes a selection to its own monitor: every rect it
stores or emits is in absolute logical virtual-desktop coordinates, the same
space `Frame`/`monitor_geometry` use, which is what makes a selection
spanning two monitors arithmetic rather than a special case.

class OverlayWindow(QWidget):
    """The overlay redesign's shell: one frameless window spanning the whole
    virtual desktop, per docs/design/overlay-redesign.md.

    SNX-31 built the background frame and dim scrim; SNX-32 added the
    selection frame -- the marching-ants stroke, corner brackets and edge
    handles; SNX-33 made that selection re-frameable. SNX-34 (this ticket)
    adds the ink layer itself: `_marks` are stored and painted in this
    widget's own window coordinates, clipped to the selection, per
    docs/design/overlay-redesign.md's "Ink lives in screen coordinates" --
    so re-framing moves the clip over marks that never move themselves.
    SNX-38 adds the eraser: `erase_at`/`undo_erase`, hit-testing marks via
    `Shape.hit_test` only while `set_eraser_active` has armed it, per the
    spec's "Marks become hit-testable only while the eraser is active."
    SNX-39 adds the general undo/redo/clear stack over `_marks` itself
    (`undo`/`redo`/`clear`, distinct from the eraser's own single-slot
    `undo_erase`) plus `copy`/`save`, which render `_marks` fresh at the
    moment they're called -- replacing the old editor.py flow's bug of
    copying the un-annotated capture once, before any annotation could
    exist. SNX-40 (this ticket) adds `FloatingBar` itself as a real child
    widget (`_bar`), wired to `undo`/`redo`/`clear`/`copy`/`save` and to
    `set_eraser_active`, and kept positioned under `_selection` by
    `_sync_bar_visibility`. The drawing-tool mouse handling that would
    actually call `add_mark` from a live drag -- for every tool but the
    eraser, which SNX-38 already wired end to end -- is still a later
    ticket in the same arc.

    Unlike `Overlay` above -- one instance per monitor, selection kept in
    absolute logical virtual-desktop coordinates so per-monitor crops tile
    correctly -- this is a *single* window covering the whole desktop, and
    per the spec's state table (`sel: QRect # window coords`) its selection
    is kept in window coordinates: local to this widget's own top-left, not
    the virtual desktop's. `frame` is expected to be a single capture
    already spanning every monitor -- what `BackendRegistry.capture()`
    returns -- not a per-monitor crop.

    Per CLAUDE.md's one architectural rule, the compositor is asked for
    pixels exactly once, upstream in `capture.py`; the frame handed in here
    is already frozen, and the spec's own deviation note applies: this never
    uses `QScreen.grabWindow(0)`, which returns black on Wayland.
