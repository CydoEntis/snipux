"""Frozen-frame selection windows, one per monitor.

Per CLAUDE.md's one architectural rule, the compositor is only ever asked
for pixels once (in `capture.py`). Everything here is ordinary painting and
mouse/key handling on the `Frame` that grab already produced — no code path
in this module asks for a fresh screen read while the user is dragging.

`Overlay` never re-zeroes a selection to its own monitor: every rect it
stores or emits is in absolute logical virtual-desktop coordinates, the same
space `Frame`/`monitor_geometry` use, which is what makes a selection
spanning two monitors arithmetic rather than a special case.
